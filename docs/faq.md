## I'm using `opendns` and started getting an error

In October 2021, users started experiencing connection issues to openDNS. It appears the server for
diagnostic.opendns.com is configured incorrectly and the server's certificate chain is incomplete. This is causing a
verification error. Rather than try and download the missing cert in the code I decided it's better to change the
default to ifconfig.co and point opendns to ipify.org in the code to support backwards compatibility. This change was
made and released as version 1.2.1 in November 2021. It will remain in effect until openDNS resolves their issue. More
information is available in [this reported issue](https://github.com/sjmayotte/route53-dynamic-dns/issues/18)

## I keep getting an error and the process won't run

Check to make sure all variables are set properly in `.env` or passed properly into the Docker Container at runtime.
Review the documentation on [Environment Variables](/route53-dynamic-dns/config/env/)
and [Docker Usage](/route53-dynamic-dns/usage/docker/)
